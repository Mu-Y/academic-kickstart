Hi, there! My name is Mu Yang. I obtained by M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering at University of Southern California(USC). Currently I am working as a research assistant at [Plus Lab](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~npeng/group.html), a [Natural Language Processing](https://www.isi.edu/research_groups/nlg/home) group, at USC [Information Scienceses Institute](https://www.isi.edu/)(ISI), fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Nanyun (Violet) Peng](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~npeng/). I am now applying for PhD starting from Fall 2020.

My research interests lie in Natural Language Understanding and Informatoin Extraction, specifically Event Temporal Relation Extraction and Biomedical Event Extraction. Previously I also work on Spoken Language Understanding and Speech Synthesis, collaborating with [Prof. Panayiotis Georgiou](http://scuba.usc.edu/panos) and folks from [SCUBA Lab](http://scuba.usc.edu/) at USC.
