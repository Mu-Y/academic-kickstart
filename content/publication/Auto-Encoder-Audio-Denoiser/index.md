abstract: "This assignment implements an Auto-Encoder Neural Network based Audio Denoiser. Training speech is a female speech and training noise is from cafeteria noise, while test speech is a male speech and test noise is from raining noise. The Auto-Encoder trys to reconstruct the clean audio from the mixed audio. Mel-frequency Spectrum features are used to train the Neural Network."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.

### Method

Mel-frequency Spectrum features are used to train the Auto-encoder Network.

For more details, take a look at the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Mu-Y/SynthSing/blob/master/Final_report.pdf).

### Dataset

Audio downloaded from YouTube. Sox is used for audio pre-processing(e.g. downsampling and trimming)

### Results(Audio Samples)

Listen to some of our sythesized audio samples below!

- Trained on NIT data. We took one of the training recordings as target. Resynthesized using true F0, generated MFSC and AP.

    - [Synthesized](https://soundcloud.com/mu-yang-974011976/hit_004_synthesized?in=mu-yang-974011976/sets/results-for-synthsing)
- Trained on NIT data. Generating previously unseen sequences by splicing together random clips from the NIT recordings and doing a similar concatenation of the corresponding F0 and phonemes for each audio clip.

- Trained on self-created dataset. we resynthesized recordings in the Coldplay dataset using true F0 and AP, and MFSCs generated by the harmonic submodel.
